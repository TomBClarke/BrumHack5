BrumHack 5.0 - Brainy Bird

## Content ##

The overall plan for the project is as follows:

* Use the Muse headband to detect eye-brow movement.
* The eye-brow movement will be used to play our own edition of Flappy Bird!
* An Amazon Webserver will be available to submit scores to and will maintain a leader board.
* You can text the web service a name (a friendâ€™s name) and it'll reply with their score, position in the ranks and the difference between you and them.
